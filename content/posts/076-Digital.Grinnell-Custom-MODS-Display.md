[Digital.Grinnell](https://digital.grinnell.edu) has seen a lot of customization over the years, and quite a bit of it relates to how an object's metadata, especially its [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) metadata, is displayed. My aim for the past couple of years has been to remove as much customization as possible, but I've found it difficult to remove features of our MODS display because those features seem to be rather popular. This is particulary true of our compound object display.

## Custom Compound/Child MODS Display

At present, May 28, 2020, the MODS display for a typical compound/child object in Digital.Grinnell looks something like the example image from [grinnell:10365](https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell:10365) included here:

And that's a wrap.  Until next time, stay safe and wash your hands! :smile:
